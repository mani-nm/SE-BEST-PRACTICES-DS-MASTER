Description: # Software Engineering for Data Scientists
        
        This training is designed to help Data Scientists gain valuable skills in Software Engineering.
        
        ## 1. Description
        
        ### 1.1 Business case
        
        The demo project used to make you practice the training's concepts is about predicting future sales for a **fictive retail company named ACME Inc.**
        
        Based on historical data, our ML model must be able to predict the sales volume for a given product, **for the coming week.**
        
        ### 1.2 Data
        
        The `data/` directory contains fake data representing ACME Inc.'s sales on a 3-year period.
         
        - `products.csv` contains a list of 100 products, sold in different stores,
        - `sotres.csv` contains a list of 10 stores which sell the aforementioned products,
        - `transactions.csv` contains more than 1 million data points from May 2016 to May 2019, listing how many units of a given product where sold in a given store on a given day.
        
        `NOTE`
        
        > This data is totally fake. Consequently, the evaluation metrics values are meaningless. The goal is not to improve them!
        
        
        ## 2. Training workflow
        
        A Jupyter Notebook `notebook.ipynb` has been created, and is available in the root directory. 
        
        This notebook contains R&D code that implements a full Data Science workflow, from data ingestion, to data processing, to feature engineering, to model fitting.
        
        The notebook code is light-years away from being "production ready"! It is hard to read, hard to understand, and trying to maintain this code and make it evolve in a production environment would be close to impossible.
        
        **The goal of this training is to create a viable software project based on this draft notebook.**
